    "lyrics": "Turn around! \nLook at what you've done. \nHad a lot of fun. \nEvery time avoided it \nSaying, \"Life has just begun!\". \nYou found no way \nAnd chose to stay. \nTherefore remember \nEvery single day will pay! \n\nOK. \nHeat it up! Take a bit of time and get it on. \nHeat it up! It might take a while to let it off. \nHeat it up! La la la la la la la. \nLa la la la la. \n\nHeat it up now! \nHeat it up now  \nBecause you don't know:  \nYou're going to see me there.   \n\nLook ahead! Our fate is going to take us to the way. \nLook above! The growing entropy will lead us to the way. \nDealing with the buzzing around us \nScrolling through bridges about us. \nEverything cannot be same \nWhen these confessions surround us. \nLook across! Those angels will be waiting on our way. \n\nWatch out! \nHeat it up! Make it up before you're taken up. \nHeat it up! Time is little so begin now. \nHeat it up! Na na na na na na na. \nNa na na na na. \nHeat it up! Take a bit of time and get it on.  \nHeat it up! It might take a while to let it off.  \nHeat it up! La la la la la la la.  \nLa la la la la. \n\nHeat it up now! \nHeat it up now \nBecause you don't know:  \nYou're going to see me there."
