	"lyrics": "See the young boy jump out of the box. \nWith the trend going up and down in the blocks.\nDon't I want to rip off the charts and the clocks? \nWhen I move like this, say \"Ooh! La la la.\". \nDoes he look worthless? No pain, no gain.\nDon't listen. Come here, baby. You got the brains.\nGet in the rickshaw. Get off the train\nBecause the boy's got me grooving like \"Ooh! La la la.\".\n\nWhen you get to see\nThe true face of me\nYou'll know\nIt's something I do.\n\nBoy, you're shining \nThrough the space. \nNot sun, not moon, the glow\nComes from your grace.\nNo, no, no! There is nothing \nWrong with your face. \nI've a lot so, \nLet me talk about you, baby!\n\nYou are stuck and \nWant to flee. \nYou got no friends, \nYou can't break free.\nI can feel you \nBecause you're me. \nLet me love you. \nLet me love you, love you, baby!\n\nEvery moment at their service, \nOh! They look so glad, huh? \nRemember, don't play with me \nBecause I am no pi√±ata. No, no!\nI'm so tired of being broken and thrown.\n\nThey can keep up, \nBut I won't give up.\nI'll glow.\nIt's something I do.\n\nLetting me down, you know what?\nThere, you got it nasty.\nThinking you can get me done with;\nYou are such a class B.\nAll I want to do is alert.\nI bet you don't\nWant to see the bad boy I can be\nIf you harrass me.\n\nJust kidding, O babe!\nLook at myself stuck in fitting in, oi!\nDigging it, aye!\nI can do anything, let's begin it, oi!\nWe get it, aye!\nThe space is looking like a ring.\nThrowing in my punches\nAnd kicks, and everything. Yeah!\n\nBullies all over\nGot the muscle and the curse.\nI'm no master, but\nI can shoot my words.\nMe and my business,\nI'm OK. Now please\nSit on the sides.\nI got a beat to slay.\n\nWhen you work hard, you get what you claim.\nBackstage, crowning the hall of fame.\nMaking up phrases; Hip-Hop's the game.\nBetter back off! Param Siddharth's my name.\nWork hard, baby! Come and get what you claim.\nBackstage, crowning the hall of fame.\nMaking up phrases; Hip-Hop's the game.\nListen, everybody hail! Param Siddharth's my name.\n\nWhen you going to hate me,\nBait me, trade me, such a player you are!\nOh, you going to hurt me,\nBreak me. Hey, please, just give it up.\n\nWhat you hear about me is phoney.\nI am great once you get to know me.\nThere's so much you can show me.\nPlease go slowly.\n\nMaybe one day,\nForever away, I'll go.\n\nSomething I do.\nI'mma wait for the doom!\nAll the haters out there, knockout! Boom boom!\n\nI'm a victim but I grow with the pain.\nStanding one full shot, utilize my brain.\nI'm a diamond, I can shine in my stains.\nHere I come again! Ooh! La la la.\n\nYou said you know my pain.\nThe truth is you don't know.\n\nI've been living like it all my life.\nBashed every other time. Baby, I don't mind you.\nIt's my life. In my kurta-pajama\nI can move wherever I want to.\n\nSomething I do."
