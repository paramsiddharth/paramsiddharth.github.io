	"lyrics": "Oh, love! \nAm I never going to hug you again? \nAm I never going to see you again?\nAm I never going to hear you again? \n\nOh, love! \nI'm asking for one last chance. \nWith time, I'll master romance. \nCome, fly with me. Let's dance. \n\nNot sure what path I'm going to take (take). \nDon't care if I'm ever going to wake (wake). \nAll I know is that it is going to be such an \nEarly morning confusion.\n\nTimes are changing. You're \nBroken, I'm sad. \nWhat is the reason? \nWhat, what, what is the reason? \nYou're one of the biggest \nTreasures I had. \nWhy are you leaving? \nWhy, why, why are you leaving? \n\nNot sure what path I'm going to take (take). \nDon't care if I'm ever going to wake (wake). \nAll I know is that it is going to be such an \nEarly morning confusion.\n\nLet me wake up (let me wake up) \nTo a world of imaginations. \nLet me wake up (let me wake up) \nTo a crazy celebration. \nLet me wake up. (Let me wake up) \nIt's my final day on Earth. \nLet me wake up. (Let me wake up) \nLet me live for what it's worth.\n\nYou say that you're afraid.\nForever's not that big, you know.\n\nI know what path I'm going to take (take), \nAnd I feel like I'm never going to wake (wake). \nAll I know is that it is going to be such an \nEarly morning confusion."
