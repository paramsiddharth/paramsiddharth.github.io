	"lyrics": "Moments till you avoid me \nI'll blow like thunder in your eyes. \nYou were off in your life. \nDidn't you hear my cries? \nI wonder what you will say \nIf I tell you I am in love. \nThat's amazing! Why are you so \nTaken by surprise? \n\nEveryday, only when I think of you does my work begin. \nEvery night, only when I hear you voice do I sleep. \nLook around: Do you think anybody else loves you more? \nDon't you see whenever you look at me, I smile? \n\nLove me. Come, love me do. \nLove me. Come, love me do.\n\nCome to me! \nTrust me, you will feel better. \nCome to me! \nI will not let your dreams shatter. \nCome to me! \nCome, see the change. \nCome to me! \nI will never hurt you again. \n\nIt is crazy falling in love and\nThe true lover's heart will know. \nYou let me feel it \nAnd my feelings helped it grow. \nI will stay undercover. \nLet a little spline dover \nJust into your life. Oh, \nWill it hurt too much? \nI don't mind, let it be. \nForget me and be free. \nPerhaps it wasn't me \nWho was meant to be \nForever yours, my love! \nNobody else, you were the \nOne I chose, my love! \nEvery time I told myself \nYou'll stay apart from me. \nI didn't realize when you \nBecame a part of me! \nTo light up the candle, \nAll it takes is a spark, \nBut I need no light, for \nHope glows in the dark. \nBurning like a candle is my love for you, \nAnd I know the end of it will be my end, my love! \n\nUndercover, the silent lover, \nResting on a cot, looks up at the moon. \nI will not let my love hurt you more. \nI will keep it within me forever. \n\nCome, come. Come. \nJust come. Come to me. \nCome, come. Come. \nJust come. Come to me. \n\nCome to me! \nTrust me, you will feel better. \nCome to me! \nI will not let your dreams shatter. \nCome to me! \nCome on, see the change. \nCome to me! \nI will never hurt you again. \n\nNever. Never ever. \nNever ever, never. \nNever. Never ever. \nNever ever. Ever. \nI will never hurt you again. \nCome to me!"
