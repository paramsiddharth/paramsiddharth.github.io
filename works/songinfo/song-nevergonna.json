Param Siddharth's my name.\nNever going to leave you.\nNever going to leave you.\n\nGirl, you know I’m alright\nTo stay up with you all night.\nWaiting for the day I\nGet to make you all mine.\n\nBaby, I can give you\nHappiness of all kinds.\nYou say we can never be together,\nBut why?\n\nOh, never.\nGirl, I’m never, never,\nYeah, I’m never, never,\nOh never, never,\nGirl, I’m never going to leave you. \n\nNo one has ever seen you\nThe way I perceive you.\nBaby girl, I love you.\nI'm never going to leave you.\n\nMaybe it’s your eyes or\nMaybe it’s your heart or\nMaybe it’s my love that\nI’m never going to leave you.\n\nTururu tututu tururu,\nTururu tututu tururu,\nTururu tututu tururu,\nTururu.\nGirl, I'm never going to leave you.\n\nTake your time, I won’t rush with you. \nPilferin’, makin’ puns with you.\nYou’re American so let me buy some guns with you.\nI think I fell in love with you, baby.\n\nYou like cricket? Making runs with you. \nHaving daughters, having sons with you (just kidding). \nWriting code, building stuff with you. \nYou can tell, I’m in love with you, baby.\n\nCan of coke, baby,\nI’mma pop it open for you.\nExams coming, baby,\nPraying, I’ll be hoping for you.\nTime to meet you.\nThere’s work. I’ll be hushing for you.\nGot a sign. You’re online.\nI’ll be rushing for you.\n\nAhaha! Yeah!\n\nदिल है दिल, जान-ए-जान।\nमैं भला क्या करूँ?\nFluttering heart made of rock and\nI don't know why.\n\nBlessed are all of the times,\nThe times that I made you laugh.\nCursed are some of the moments\nI made you cry.\n\nOh, never.\nGirl, I’m never, never,\nYeah, I’m never, never,\nOh never, never,\nGirl, I’m never going to leave you. \n\nEverybody comes and then\nEverybody leaves you.\nTrust me, I relate, and\nI’m never going to leave you. \n\nI wish everyday and\nEvery night again that\nYou tell me that you love me.\nI’m never going to leave you.\n\nआधी-आधी रात और \nसंग मेरे तू।\nमुझे अच्छा लगता है। \nI’m never going to leave you. \n\nDoesn’t matter if you’re here\nOr a million miles away. \nIf I’m saying then I mean it:\nI’m never going to leave you. \n\nTururu tututu tururu,\nTururu tututu tururu,\nTururu tututu tururu,\nTururu.\nGirl, I'm never going to leave you.\n\nI know that you still cry for him, baby.\nIf he comes back, I know that you’ll die for him, baby.\nI want to do things right for you, baby.\nUnlike him, I promise, I will fight for you, baby.\n\nवैसे तो I don’t drink, but I’m high for you, baby.\nI know I ain’t perfect, but I will try for you, baby.\nवैसे तो I’m honest, I can lie for you, baby.\nNo, I don’t have wings, but I can fly to you, baby.\n\nRight on, right here, right now, for you, baby.\nRight on, right here, right now, for you, baby.\nRight on, right here, right now, for you, baby.\nRight on, right here, right now, for you, baby.\n\nAin’t you sure we can be together?\nI’ve been sticking around\nFor 7 years and counting.\n\nI’m the friendzone type of guy.\nOf course, we started off as friends.\n\nI’mma pray, O Bajrang Bali ji!\nFor the day I take you out on a date. \nFor you I can be the man of the kingdom. \nI can go out of my way.\n\nIf I'm telling you I love you,\nBaby, take it as a sign. \nIf I tell you we’re forever,\nWould you tell me that you’re mine?\n\nOh, never.\nGirl, I’m never, never,\nYeah, I’m never, never,\nOh never, never,\nGirl, I’m never going to leave you. \n\nWhen I tell you that you are\nStupid and I hate you,\nMaybe what I mean is I’m\nNever going to leave you.\n\nNot a little bit here,\nNot a little bit there. No, no.\nBaby, I'm all yours, and\nI'm never going to leave you.\n\nStill going be around when\nYou don’t need me anymore.\nBaby, tell me what to do\nBecause I’m never going to leave you.\n\nTururu tututu tururu,\nTururu tututu tururu,\nTururu tututu tururu,\nTururu.\nGirl, I'm never going to leave you.\n\nThere's no limit to my love for you,\nFor my love approaches infinity!\nIn your arms, in your arms, baby,\nमुझे जीवन बिताना है।\nAfraid of the consequences?\nI say, la-la-later! Back on that, later!\nIn the rare event that I pass away,\n𑂞𑂷𑂯𑂩𑂰 𑂩𑂎𑂧 𑂢 𑂍𑂷𑂢𑂷 𑂬𑂱𑂍𑂰𑂨𑂞, 𑂯𑂷𑃀\n\nAlways going to love you.\nAlways be together. \nNever going to leave you.\nNever moving on.\n\nTell you that I want you. \nTell you that I need you. \nYou know that I love you, \nYou and you alone.\n\nWhy would I be lazy\nWhen you’re with me, crazy?\nYou say that it’s late but\nI don’t want to go.\n\nGirlie, when we’re aged\nAnd our vision’s faded,\nWho would be my lady?\nYou’re the one I’d want.\n\nYou can never love me. Oh!\nYou can never love me and\nI can never hate you.\nBaby girl, I'm sorry.\nI'm never going to leave you.\n\nI know that I want you, but\nYou don’t think I need you. \nI would rather die if \nI’m ever going to leave you.\n\nYou knew all along, baby.\nStill ain’t going to leave you.\n\nGirl, I'm never going to leave you."
