I used to doubt it,\nBut now that I have found it:\nYeah! Yeah-yeah-yeah;\n\nBecause my baby's got\nOooh! Angel eyes.\nYeah! My baby's got\nOooh! Angel eyes. \n\nTill now, I have been there down and lonely. \nI wish if only \nThe whole world could feel my vibe. \nWe all need one simple reason: \nSomething to believe in. \nI know that I have got mine; \n\nBecause my baby's got\nOooh! Angel eyes.\nYeah! My baby's got\nOooh! Angel eyes."
