	"lyrics": "Call it the dawn of adulthood\nBecause I get those memories.\nI see kids falling in love.\nOh my! Those were the days.\n\nVery often, I think of you.\nI kind of get the chills, yeah!\nSeparation is inevitable,\nBut don't get upset, please.\n\nSometimes I could say, \"I don't love you.\".\nSometimes I'm like, \"Go away!\".\nSometimes I can go a little over\nWhat you can take on everyday.\n\nGatifull! It's about time on radar.\nBroke into my heart, left a crater.\nOur love at the peak. Up and greater.\nI don't care. I still love you, my hater.\n\nGatifull! It's about time on radar.\nLive it up and then turn down the fader.\nMaking you wait, call me waiter.\nHeart beating like a raindrop.\n\nWhenever you're by my side, then I'm happy.\nWhen I hold your hand, then I'm OK.\nWhenever I see you before me,\nOh, oh!\n\nOff goes misery.\nOh, na na na na!\nVoice goes jittery.\nUh, oh, baby!\n\nI feel shivery.\nOh, na na na na!\nHere's my victory:\nYou!\n\nGatifull! It's about time on radar.\nGetting too loud, turn down the fader.\nOur love at the peak. Up and greater.\nI don't care. I still love you, my hater.\n\nGatifull! It's about time on radar.\nTop-down the poles and Equator.\nCan't help it, sometimes I fear.\nAh, ah!\n\nBecause love has it's own battles, aye!\nIt hurts when a heart shatters, aye!\nWhat if we're ever going to break up?\nYou say, \"La la later! Back on that, later!\".\n\nGatifull! It's about time on radar.\nOscillation top-down the fader.\nOur love at the peak. Up and greater.\nI told you that I love you, my hater.\n\nLa la la, la la la, la la la la la la la\nLa la la, la la la la!\nLa la la, la la la, la la la la la la la\nLa la, la la la la la la!"
