    "lyrics": "Will you come here,\nAnd stand by me?\nUnderstanding me, look into my eyes (Eyes, baby!).\nStay with me\nFor some time.\nLet's keep away the tender goodbyes (Goodbyes, baby!).\n\nCame as a frightening lightning,\nLeft me brightening, brightening.\nYou probably were the best\nThing to happen to me (To me!).\nGoing nowhere else\nLeaving this love enlightening\nBecause I still crave that\nLovely smile again.\n\nFalling for divinity:\nIs it called insanity?\nFeeling the affinity\nFor my love approaches infinity!\n\nGravitation (The force)\nIs abound\nFor beloved people cause attraction (O Love!).\nWhat we give is\nWhat we seek:\nIt is clearly love and care and attention (Attention, baby!).\n\nTell me, O darling!\nTell me, my love!\nI miss you very much. Don't you know?\nAlas! I love you.\nHow much I wish\nThat you understood the language of love (Love, baby!).\n\nCome closer to me,\nFor my heart is waiting\nVery eagerly for our conversation, love.\nThere is no explanation,\nJust a proclamation:\nI promise that I will love you forever (And ever, baby!).\n\nFalling for divinity:\nIs it called insanity?\nFeeling the affinity\nFor my love approaches infinity!\n\nInfinity! Your love approaches infinity.\nInfinity! Your love approaches infinity.\nInfinity! Your love approaches infinity.\nInfinity! Your love approaches infinity.\nMy love approaches infinity.\n\nYou are my sunshine, sunshine:\nSuch a darling, darling,\nThat I wish to spend the\nRest of my life with you, love.\nI will never hurt you,\nI will never let you go.\nWe together will make\nThe world a better place.\n\nFallen for divinity,\nFlourishing insanity,\nFrom the strength of gravity\nFor my love approaches infinity!"
