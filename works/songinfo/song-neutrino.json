    "lyrics": "Getting out of the \nPrison called life. \nYes, I know that \nWe can make it. \nLet me go \nOn the way.\n\nJumping hard and \nClimbing all heights \nIs a risk, but we \nCan take it. \nLet me go \nOn the way. \n\nWe're abundant, yet \nWe're underappreciated. \nThat's not fair, or is it? \nDown under the \nShining beauty of \nEverything, we're there to serve them. \n\nI am a neutrino, oh! \nNo topping, no amino, oh! \nNo trailing like zero, oh! \nJust existing in parallel. \n\nWaking up and thinking about \nThe very thought of living \nAnd then panicking and grieving \nAll the pain I got. \nWhenever you're needy, \nI be ready for you, baby! \nI can only do so much. \n\nCome on, AT! Rocking upbeat, over two feet, \nWord on the street, yeah! We heat it like a treat. \nRetreat, never recede. Always be free. \nBig heap of the rich gold, in the whole week. \nThere's a whole lot in the jar. \nNo, I ain't talking. I'm a superstar. \nTake my warning, she will take you far. \nIf you don't know her, she's BIZARRE. \n\nAbundant, yet \nWe're underappreciated. \nWe both know that \nWe are going to change it. \nDown under the \nShining beauty of \nEverything, we're there to serve them. \n\nI am a neutrino, oh! \nNo topping, no amino, oh! \nI want to be a hero, oh! \nJust existing in parallel."
