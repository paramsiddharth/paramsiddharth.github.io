	"lyrics": "I've been waiting for the right time\nTo let you know that I've been looking for you all of my life.\nFeels like walking on a landslide.\nLet me take you, take you down.\n\nOoh, baby! I need you here in my life.\nOoh, baby! I can't let you out of my sight.\nOoh, baby! I don't care if you ain't my type.\nDon't even know you but I can't get you out of my mind.\n\nGirl, I can't get you out of my mind.\n(I can't get you, I can't get you, get you out of my mind.)\n(I can't get you, I can't get you, get you out of my mind.)\nGirl, I can't get you out of my mind.\n(I can't get you, I can't get you, get you out of my mind.)\nOoh! Ooh! Yeah.\n\nGirl, you know you got it easy.\nYou got me tossing and turning, thinking of what we could be.\nI've been searching for the words,\nBut how do I say everything I need to?\nEverything I need to, huh? Yeah.\n\nI been tryna get you out of sight and out of mind.\nYou been hooked to me for 40 days and 40 nights.\nI know better than to keep checking if you're still online\nI can't help it. I can't help it!\n\nOoh, baby! I need you here in my life.\nOoh, baby! I can't let you out of my sight.\nOoh, baby! I don't care if you ain't my type.\nDon't even know you but I can't get you out of my mind.\n\nGirl, I can't get you out of my mind.\n(I can't get you, I can't get you, get you out of my mind.)\n(I can't get you, I can't get you, get you out of my mind.)\nGirl, I can't get you out of my mind.\n(I can't get you, I can't get you, get you out of my mind.)\nOoh! Ooh! Yeah."
