So glad, friend.\n\nGood friend, bad friend.\nNot this friend, no, that friend.\nI'm lonely. So sad, friend.\nMay I hold your hand, friend?\n\nBaby, it'll be OK.\nAww baby, you'll be OK.\nYes baby, you'll be OK.\nCome on baby, it's OK.\n\nWon't leave you. I will stay.\nYou're busy? I shall wait.\nYou need me? I'll be there.\nDon't seem so, but I care.\n\nBaby, it'll be OK.\nAww baby, you'll be OK.\nYes baby, you'll be OK.\nCome on baby, it's OK.\n\nGood friend, bad friend.\n\nFell in love and fell right out of it.\nFell in love and fell right out of it.\nFell in love and fell right out of it.\nFell in love and fell right out of it.\n\nBaby, it'll be OK.\nAww baby, you'll be OK.\nYes baby, you'll be OK.\nCome on baby, it's OK.\n\nकभी भी तेरा बुरा नहीं चाहा मैंने । \nकभी भी कोई ताना नहीं मारा मैंने । \nकभी भी कुछ ग़लत न बोला । \nतूने मांगा प्रेम, मैंने भर दिया झोला ।"
