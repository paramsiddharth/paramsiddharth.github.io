Yeah!\nPut it on the real, \nPut it on the real blog! \n\nOK, yeah! Aye yeah! \nOh yeah! Aye yeah! \nOh yeah! I'm dramatic, \nNo static. I'm cinematic. \nWhat is my tactic? I don't need plastic. \nI'm not Patrick. I got graphic. \nI hate the traffic. It's not elastic. \nNot fantastic. It's a panic. \nI do care! \nI do care, huh! \nLook at my hair! \nLook at my hair, huh! \nI do a dare \nOn my friend's chair, huh! OK, \nLook at her glare. \nShe don't even want to share, huh! \n\nOK, Megastack! Megastack! \nMegastack! Megawhack! \nI feel like I got \nNumber one on my plainback! \nWhat is that? What is that? \nWhat is that? I'mma smack. \nI got macaroni and cheese in my hatchback! \n\nStinky fish: Stinky fish \nIs the worst kind of dish. \nI got homies that can swish. \nPlease girl, don't switch. \nI'm not your average fish. \nI can squish \nThat jellyfish, \nLike a wish, \nOn that catfish. \nI'm not finished. \nI'm not British, \nBut I can take you to my scrimmage, \nAnd we can make it super vintage. \nI'll bring spinach. \nWhat's the menace? \nI was like, \nI want a sandwich \nOn a downshift. \n\nOK, my clothes is too froze, huh! \nI hope that my mom knows, huh! \nI plan to get her a rose, huh! \nI hope that she doesn't know, huh! \nI go, go, oh!\nLook at my nose, huh! \nOh, do I keep saying \nThat what did I compose, huh? \nAye, what up, Joe? I got no foes, huh! \nThat's how it goes, don't be too slow, huh! \n\nOK, Megastack! Megastack! \nMegastack! Megawhack! \nI feel like I got \nNumber one on my plainback! \nWhat is that? What is that? \nWhat is that? I'mma smack. \nI got macaroni and cheese in my hatchback!"
