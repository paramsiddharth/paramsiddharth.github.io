	"lyrics": "Oh, Carol!\nI am but a fool.\nDarling, I love you,\nThough you treat me cruel.\n\nYou hurt me\nAnd you make me cry,\nBut if you leave me,\nI will surely die.\n\nDarling there will never be another\nBecause I love you. So\nDon't ever leave me.\nSay you'll never go.\n\nI will always treat you as my sweetheart,\nNo matter what you do.\nOh, Carol!\nI'm so in love with you.\n\nWhen I was just a little baby,\nAnd I didn't have many toys,\nThen my mama used to say, \"Son,\nYou got more than other boys.\nNow, you may not be good-looking,\nAnd you may not be too rich,\nBut you will never-ever be alone,\nBecause you got lucky lips.\".\n\nLucky lips are always kissing.\nLucky lips are never blue.\nLucky lips will always find you\nA pair of lips so true.\nI don't need a four-leaf clover,\nA rabbit's foot, or a good luck charm.\nWith lucky lips you'll always have\nA baby in your arms."
