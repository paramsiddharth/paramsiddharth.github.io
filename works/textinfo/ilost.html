Once green and alive, 
The tree looks feeble now. 
Leaves grew brown, fell down. 
The branches were shaved. 
We thought the tree has died, 
But all it took 
Was the end of autumn 
For it to be green again. 

When he didn't talk wild, 
The animals ran away. 
The jungle faded of sound. 
The silence was the end of peace. 
He still knew though, 
The animals would come back 
Someday, to talk to him 
All wild again. 

You weren't right. I wasn't wrong. 
I didn't lose admiration. 
I lost courage. 
You were wrong 
Because I never stopped loving you. 
I just stopped showing it. 
I accept. I lost.
