;
Far somewhere, 
In the silently loud night, 
My soul is fading 
Into eternity. 
I beckon her to stay, 
But she goes farther. 
The more I plead, 
The lesser of her I see. 
As time passes, 
My love for her grows, 
Whence I shall cherish 
All my moments with her. 
My love shall thrive 
Till my very end.
