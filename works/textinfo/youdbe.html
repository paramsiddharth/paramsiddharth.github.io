;
For your acceptance, I will have to pay. 
I already am no less beggar to say. 
Even though I proclaim it with grace, 
Loving you was a blunder in first place.
My heart overwhelmingly warns me clear. 
Where are you tonight? You said you'd be here. 
I don't know exactly, but somewhere I bled 
When you hurt me, left me all wrecked, and fled. 
A threat to my sanity, your memories prevail 
In worthless sorrow, but I shall not wail. 
Aye, but it hit me when you pointed hither, 
Looked at me, and said, "We can't be together.". 
Wait for the end of eternity to see: 
Till the very soul of existence be free, 
In unseen heavens, just you and me,
Maybe not now, but we're meant to be.
