Candle bliss
Getting blown away
By the winds of terror,
Drawing fits of horror
Towards me, sending off all fuel,
Ah! so cruel, yet so consistent.

Candle bliss
Looking all calm,
Like a flame within palms,
Yet confined does blaze such thunder
Forcing me from here to there
Lest that be my end.

Candle bliss:
Units beneath
Lies molten sorrow.
Lo! no way does it fuel again,
Follows it haunting desolation,
Rather destroying morrow.

Candle bliss
Scores the same
As devil come by the soul.
For let me not discuss that thing
So unjust, drag the bleeding heart
To levels as a whole.

Candle bliss
Destroyed my life,
False happiness it brought.
Since all that was has flown away,
I am left with dreadful drought.

Candle bliss
Be truth untold,
Sincere consoling lie:
Currents unfold that pull away
Some joy that should come by.

Candle bliss;
Left me alone
Everything that came to me.
O darling! I loved you too much,
Go, leave me and be free.

For all my courage got me nothing
But agony and despair.
Alas! how much I wish I had
Some love, friendship, and care.

For all my learning got me nothing
Besides advancing lone.
Alas! how much I wish there were
Some flesh and not just bone.

For all my love got me nowhere
Except this silent drear:
This painful sense of certitude:
Doubt that thou loved me too.

Thought I, at last, I found thou, love,
I never did suspect.
Yet, did thou everything to me
That I did not expect.

Me at my worst, you left me there
Just like all others did.
Come, speak up, O dealer of hearts!
How much did they bid?

Love thou, my dear, so very much
I beg thou, please don't come,
For after all thou did to me,
My heartfelt love is numb.

The declination and the dilemma
Broke me off my stem.
So, do not give me reasons now.
Don't love me as I am. 

Close to me you used to be:
Those days, the ones I miss.
Behind my idiosyncrasies:
I just got candle bliss.
