Life is full of ups and downs. 
Always the same, there is nothing new. 
That's why, never lose the opportunity 
To learn, be honest, sincere, and true. 

Let go of bad habits and negativity, 
Your conscience is what you should defend. 
Life going on peacefully with a smile on one's face 
â€” That's all that matters in the end. :)
