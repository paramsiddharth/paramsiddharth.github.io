;
I have met you so many times in my dreams, 
That it isn't amazing that I always wait for you to come. 

I have seen uncountable persons in life, 
Yet never did I feel before as I did when I saw you come. 

I tend to smile at such trivial things in life, 
But I smile more when I witness you come. 

Sometimes I wish I could explore the stars, 
While other times I wish you could come.  

Love hurts, it sure does, but 
It feels jolly good when I hear you come. 

My frustrated taunts and silly irritations; 
I have done so much for you to overcome. 

From sad and worried to happy and gay, 
Your honoured self has made me what I have become. 

I have loved you so much inside me, 
I am longing to love you on the outside if you come. 

Never will I let your down, dear friend, 
Undefiable is our friendship's theorem.

I have spent six eternities in your love, 
And I am ready to wait another lifetime 
If you promise to come.
