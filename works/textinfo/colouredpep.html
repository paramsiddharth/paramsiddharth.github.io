;
The ones I made with her, 
She destroyed all my dreams. 
Her clever doubting eyes 
Never acknowledged 
My love, faith and loyalty. 
Yes, she's white, 
But I was never obsessed 
With the colour of skin. 

One who becomes my reason to live, 
That's the kind of girl I'd wished for, God, 
And not one with intoxicating eyes 
But no heart behind the skin. 
Perhaps she was too proud 
Of the colour of her skin. 

She must be thinking I'm devastated, 
Not knowing the bird is free now. 
Yes, I was devastated at the moment 
When she, the beautiful girl, 
Let go of my hand. 

Enough in this world of colours. 
She's white. I'm black. Not anymore. 
I've shed my colour long ago. 
I'm looking for her: 
She, who's colourless. 
I'm weak. I'm feeble. 
I'm searching for her: 
She, who'll take care of me 
And love me for who I am 
And not my looks. 
Not my colour.
